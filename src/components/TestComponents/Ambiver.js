        If you can switch between being reserved and being social, you’re most
        likely an ambivert. Ambiverts don’t mind working alone or in a group,
        neither do they have a preference when it comes to choosing between
        being introverted and extroverted. This flexible personality type works
        to your advantage in a professional setting where you may have to deal
        with different kinds of people and engage in a variety of tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being adaptable will open doors to better opportunities and you’ll find
        that you’re more receptive to your surroundings. Someone with an
        ambivert personality is also good at speaking up for themselves. They’re
        able to compartmentalize their emotions and think objectively. They can
        be assertive when they need to be and reserved in other situations.
        You’ll find that ambiverts perform well in client-facing roles. Dealing
        with clients or customers requires a lot of patience and an active
        listening habit, traits that ambiverts have.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ambivert is more inclined to give equal weightage to opposing ideas.
        Say your colleague and you are at odds over an important decision.
        You’re more likely to think about things from both perspectives before
        coming to a conclusion. You’ll weigh each option and choose the one that
        suits both you and your colleague. In a negotiation, this trait is
        especially helpful because the goal of any negotiation is a win-win
        outcome. Ambiverts will make great negotiators because of the stability
        they bring to the table.
