        You are more of an introvert
      </h1>
      <p>
        You feel that living alone is to live happily, and you prefer hiding in
        a crowd rather than standing out in one. You are perpetually tormented
        by the idea of doing things wrong, not understanding or not being alert
        enough or intelligent enough to do what others expect of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You lack in self-confidence and you seem to believe that others are
        better than you. While in a conversation, for example, you would be more
        likely to go along with the other’s points of view as you don’t fully
        respect your own opinions. Where there’s a low level task to complete or
        a service to be allotted, it’s you who volunteers. When people want to
        get out of a task, they naturally come to you as they know that you
        never say ‘no’.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not surprising that you sometimes have the impression of being
        permanently exploited, but you don’t really know how to break this
        vicious circle. On the rare occasions that you’ve tried to do so, this
        uncharacteristic defiance has caused uproar and you’ve ended up backing
        down. You are afraid of contact with others as you imagine that they are
        constantly judging you and that their probing looks will obviously find
        your faults. So, you try to remain the most transparent and discreet
        possible.
