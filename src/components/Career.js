        Top 5 Psychometric Tests for Your Career Success
      </h1>
      <p className="text-2xl text-justify">
        To make a successful career change, you have to know what type of career
        is going to suit your personality. Psychometric tests are a quick,
        convenient way of “personality typing” — getting an idea of which
        specific personality group you fall into in terms of skill sets,
        ambitions and aspirations. Once you know which group you fall into, it’s
        easier to assess what type of career might be suited to you. Personality
        psychometric tests are not to be confused with the psychometric tests
        employers use to test candidates’ ability. These are usually taken in
        exam-like conditions and involve numerical and verbal reasoning
        exercises that assess a candidate’s ability to do the job. Although
        personality psychometric tests such as OPQ32 are used by managers and
        businesses to evaluate an individual’s behavioural style, there are many
        online personality psychometric tests that you can take yourself, in
        your own time. Here are five of the most popular free tests doing the
        rounds at the moment (the headers are hyperlinks):

      <h1 className="font-bold text-3xl my-10">Jung Typology Test</h1>
      <p className="text-2xl text-justify">
        According to the thinking behind this test, personality typing involves
        classifying the individual according to four criteria:
        extroversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling,
        judging/perceiving. Different combinations of the criteria determine a
        type. For instance, if you are an Extrovert Intuition Feeling Judging,
        you are imaginatively called an EIFJ. According to which type you are,
        the test not only feeds back a list of suitable career options, but also
        some educational institutions that can give you the relevant skills
        training.

        Career Psychometrics: ‘How to Land your Ideal Job’
      </h1>
      <p className="text-2xl text-justify">
        You have 2 minutes 45 seconds to answer a short series of questions
        asking you to what extent you have certain personality traits. After
        you’ve completed it, you get a free Personality Report that explicitly
        tells you not only what type of job is for you, but also what type of
        job isn’t for you. The only catch is you have to give them your email
        address to get the free report, and then they send you some spam for a
        few days.

        Finding Potential: Individuals’ Personality Questionnaire
      </h1>
      <p className="text-2xl text-justify">
        This test takes around 15 minutes to complete and gives you a 15 page
        report that shows you the personality traits you scored higher and lower
        on; gives you a detailed breakdown of these traits; and then matches
        work preferences and possible jobs to you according to whether you
        scored high or low on each particular trait.

        This is slightly different in that, for some reason, it first asks you
        what your ‘current or desired’ career is before you take the test. It
        then gives you a list of statements and you have to indicate to what
        degree each statement is true of you. In the results it categorises you
        as a certain type of person such as an ‘Idealist’ and then gives you a
        list of possible professions. Of course, one of these professions is the
        one you put down as your ‘desired career’.

        PersonalityType.com: ‘Discover Your Perfect Career’ Quiz
      </h1>
      <p className="text-2xl text-justify">
        This uses the same criteria as the Jung Typology Test, except you
        yourself have to decide whether you are an extrovert or introvert,
        sensor or intuitive, etc. by reading bullet point descriptions of each
        pair of qualities and then picking which of the two qualities is most
        like you. After you’ve chosen from the four categories, the test
        identifies your personality type as the conventional Jung test does and
        then gives you a list of suitable careers. Obviously none of us are
        going to choose our next career exclusively on the back of a
        traffic-coaxing online test, but they are useful tools for seeing if
        you’d really be suited for that career move that’s recently caught your
        imagination. And if you have no idea what you’d like to do, it’s a fun
        way of getting a few suggestions you might never have thought of by
        yourself.
