      "People’s mood and wellbeing are affected by various elements of the built environment including spatial allocations, lighting, access to nature, colour, indoor air quality, noise, thermal comfort, user control of space, and preferred environments (i.e., those that are coherent and engaging).Numerous studies show the positive effects of daylight on human psychology and health. In the field of healthcare, many of these studies show that patients assigned to sunny rooms recover more quickly, on average than those assigned to rooms with less daylight.Access to nature and green environments yields better cognitive functioning, more self-discipline and impulse control, and greater mental health overall. Less access to nature is linked to exacerbated attention deficit, higher rates of anxiety disorders, and higher rates of clinical depression.The amount, distribution, and form of interior spaces can have profound effects on the psychological health of people. Some of the main psychological issues at play in regards to spatial allocations include territoriality, personal space, privacy, and crowding.",

    words:
      "Personality traits reflect people’s characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Personality traits imply consistency and stability—someone who scores high on a specific trait like Extraversion is expected to be sociable in different situations and over time. Thus, trait psychology rests on the idea that people differ from one another in terms of where they stand on a set of basic trait dimensions that persist over time and across situations. The most widely used system of traits is called the Five-Factor Model. This system includes five broad traits that can be remembered with the acronym OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each of the major traits from the Big Five can be divided into facets to give a more fine-grained analysis of someone's personality. In addition, some trait theorists argue that there are other traits that cannot be completely captured by the Five-Factor Model. Critics of the trait concept argue that people do not act consistently from one situation to the next and that people are very influenced by situational forces. Thus, one major debate in the field concerns the relative power of people’s traits versus the situations in which they find themselves as predictors of their behavior.",
